# EffiTourRec
We propose a new POI selection heuristic for personalized itinerary recom- mendation by considering visitors’ various preferences, i.e., POIs popularity, visitors interest, prior visitors visiting, queuing, and traveling time. We introduce an eﬀective itinerary reward function-based level of trade-oﬀ among prior visitors visiting time, POI popularity, visitor interests, and queuing time. We propose adaptive MCTS based reinforcement learning algorithm EﬃTourRec to make visitor itinerary recommendation more eﬀective and eﬃcient by using the new POI selection heuristic and reward function strategy. In addition, to improve the time eﬃciency of our proposed method, we use MCTS pruning technique to reduce search space by ﬁltering out non-optimal and duplicate itineraries in the early stages.
